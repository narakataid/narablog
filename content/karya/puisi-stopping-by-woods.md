<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="font-size: small;">Karya <a href="/authors/robert-frost/" target="_blank">Robert Frost</a></div><br />
Whose woods these are I think I know.<br />His house is in the village though;<br />He will not see me stopping here<br />To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br />My little horse must think it queer<br />To stop without a farmhouse near<br />Between the woods and frozen lake<br />The darkest evening of the year.<br />He gives his harness bells a shake<br />To ask if there is some mistake.<br />The only other soundâ€™s the sweep<br />Of easy wind and downy flake.<br />The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br />But I have promises to keep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep.</div>
