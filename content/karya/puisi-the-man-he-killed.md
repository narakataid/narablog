Had he and I but met<br />By some old ancient inn,<br />We should have set us down to wet<br />Right many a nipperkin!<br /><br />But ranged as infantry,<br />And staring face to face,<br />I shot at him as he at me,<br />And killed him in his place.<br /><br />I shot him dead because--<br />Because he was my foe,<br />Just so: my foe of course he was;<br />That's clear enough; although<br /><br />He thought he'd 'list, perhaps,<br />Off-hand like--just as I--<br />Was out of work--had sold his traps--<br />No other reason why.<br /><br />Yes; quaint and curious war is!<br />You shoot a fellow down<br />You'd treat, if met where any bar is,<br />Or help to half a crown.</div>
