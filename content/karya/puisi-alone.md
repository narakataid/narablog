Lying, thinking<br />
Last night<br />
How to find my soul a home<br />
Where water is not thirsty<br />
And bread loaf is not stone<br />
I came up with one thing<br />
And I don't believe I'm wrong<br />
That nobody,<br />
But nobody<br />
Can make it out here alone.<br />
<br />
Alone, all alone<br />
Nobody, but nobody<br />
Can make it out here alone.<br />
<br />
There are some millionaires<br />
With money they can't use<br />
Their wives run round like banshees<br />
Their children sing the blues<br />
They've got expensive doctors<br />
To cure their hearts of stone.<br />
But nobody<br />
No, nobody<br />
Can make it out here alone.<br />
<br />
Alone, all alone<br />
Nobody, but nobody<br />
Can make it out here alone.<br />
<br />
Now if you listen closely<br />
I'll tell you what I know<br />
Storm clouds are gathering<br />
The wind is gonna blow<br />
The race of man is suffering<br />
And I can hear the moan,<br />
'Cause nobody,<br />
But nobody<br />
Can make it out here alone.<br />
<br />
Alone, all alone<br />
Nobody, but nobody<br />
Can make it out here alone.</div>
