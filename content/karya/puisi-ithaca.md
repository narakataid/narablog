As you set out for Ithaka<br />
hope the voyage is a long one,<br />
full of adventure, full of discovery.<br />
Laistrygonians and Cyclops,<br />
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:<br />
you’ll never find things like that on your way<br />
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,<br />
as long as a rare excitement<br />
stirs your spirit and your body.<br />
Laistrygonians and Cyclops,<br />
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them<br />
unless you bring them along inside your soul,<br />
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.<br />
<br />
Hope the voyage is a long one.<br />
May there be many a summer morning when,<br />
with what pleasure, what joy,<br />
you come into harbors seen for the first time;<br />
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations<br />
to buy fine things,<br />
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br />
sensual perfume of every kind—<br />
as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br />
and may you visit many Egyptian cities<br />
to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.<br />
<br />
Keep Ithaka always in your mind.<br />
Arriving there is what you are destined for.<br />
But do not hurry the journey at all.<br />
Better if it lasts for years,<br />
so you are old by the time you reach the island,<br />
wealthy with all you have gained on the way,<br />
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.<br />
<br />
Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.<br />
Without her you would not have set out.<br />
She has nothing left to give you now.<br />
<br />
And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.<br />
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,<br />
you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.</div>
