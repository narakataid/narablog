I do not love you except because I love you;<br />I go from loving to not loving you,<br />From waiting to not waiting for you<br />My heart moves from cold to fire.<br /><br />I love you only because it's you the one I love;<br />I hate you deeply, and hating you<br />Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you<br />Is that I do not see you but love you blindly.<br /><br />Maybe January light will consume<br />My heart with its cruel<br />Ray, stealing my key to true calm.<br /><br />In this part of the story I am the one who<br />Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,<br />Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood.</div>
